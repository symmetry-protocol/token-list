{"SOL": "Solana is building the architecture of their blockchain based on Proof of History (PoH); a proof for verifying order and passage of time between events. The purpose of PoH is used to encode the trustless passage of time into a ledger. A Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is then leveraged for confirmation of the current sequence produced by the Proof of History generator. PoS is also used for voting and selecting the next Proof of History generator node and for punishing any validators that act against the interest of the network.\n\nUp to 710k transactions/second on a 1gb network without data partitioning\n\nProof of History\nEncoding time as data in the replicated state allows for simple and efficient proofs and protocols.\n\nPerformant System Architecture\nThe network is arranged for maximum throughput and high availability. Our smart contracts bytecode is based on Berkeley Packet Filter designed for fast execution.\n\nFast Proof of Replication\nA fast streaming Proof of Replication is designed for storing a large distributed ledger.\n\nConsensus independent from transaction flow\nTransactions flow through the network independent of consensus and are limited only by hardware."}
